# Problem Solving With Programming Languages

## Language Setup

### JavaScript

We will be using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) to
install the necessary packages and [jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io)
as our test runner.

The [installation instructions for jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/pages/getting_started.html)
are copied below.

```
npm install --save-dev jasmine
```

You can test if things are setup by running the "me" test

```
npx jasmine spec/puzzles/me_spec.js
```

You can run all tests with

```
npx jasmine
```
